This application is able to estimate a budget. 
There are 3 windows: 
First is a main view taking data about costs or income.
Second is a list of added costs
Third is a list of added income

There are used useRef hooks to connect with element in DOM. Also I've used useState hooks letting me use functional component as class component. Thanks of it I could save data to the state and use it when I needed to. This app lets you controlle your budget by applying items to one of two lists: 1) costs list and 2) income lists.
